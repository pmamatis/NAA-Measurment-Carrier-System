# NAA-Measurement-Carrier-System
This project includes the hardware and software solution of a carrier system for network attached accelerators (NAA). It is intended to be placed in a server rack and replace the common CPU-based carrier systems for hardware accelerators. It was developed as part of a master thesis at the Fraunhofer Institute HHI in the ESG group.


## Overview
This project focuses on making the use of NAAs more energy efficient and to measure their application-specific power consumption during operation. For this purpose, a system was designed and realized which consists of several PCBs and the implementation of microcontroller software. The complete project is explained in detail in the written version of the [master thesis](Doku/MasterThesis_NAA_Mess_Tr√§gerSystem_PaulMamatis.pdf)
. A further [documentation of the source code](Doku/doxygen_out/html/index.html) has been created with the help of Doxygen.

## Code
The code section contains the C code for the microcontroller, Python code for error analysis and some bash scripts for implementing a remote. 

## PCB
Contains the KiCad files for the PCB designs of the carrier module.

## Use
This repository is for application purposes and represents my latest work.
